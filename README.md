# droobots
3D printable Bristlebots

droobot-needs-support should be sliced with a "touching buildplate" option.

The regulare doobot.stl has built in support, but takes longer to print, and the support is heavier.

You should print without the fan on, or make sure it's off for the layers where the legs are printing.
